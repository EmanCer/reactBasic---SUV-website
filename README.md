This is a React project for a dinamyc single page website, I build it to consolidate the foundamentals of Reacts with the use of components, props and state

The project contains 4 major components:

- The header with a navbar. The header title and description are dynamic and are randomly generated

- The Specs and CoreModel sections both take data from a jason file, and thanks to props and destructuring generates the content.

- The ModelSelector component dynamically change content of the page based on user selection. Here is where I used the React State.
